Package with helper functions and formatting templates used by the Biostatistics team of The Kids Research Institute Australia.

# Getting started

## Installing

The Kids Research Institute Australia biostats package (`thekidsbiostats`) can be installed with the following:

```         
remotes::install_github("The-Kids-Biostats/thekidsbiostats")
```
# Using the template

There is another repository [https://github.com/The-Kids-Biostats/thekidsbiostats_template](https://github.com/The-Kids-Biostats/thekidsbiostats_template) that serves as our template repository for data workflows and reporting. It has a Quarto (`.qmd`) based templates for reporting in wither `.html` or word (`.docx`).

We would typically start a project by taking a copy of this directory.
